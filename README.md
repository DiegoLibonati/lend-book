# Lend Book

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Description

**Lend Book** is a library management system built in Python using object-oriented programming principles. It provides a clean, structured API to manage an inventory of books and a registry of users, supporting the full lifecycle of book rentals and returns.

The system revolves around a central `Manager` class that acts as the single orchestrator for all operations. It maintains an in-memory catalog of books and a registry of users, each identified by a unique UUID. Through the `Manager`, you can register and remove users, add and remove books from the catalog, and process book rentals and returns — all with validation and business rules enforced at every step.

Books are modeled with an inventory counter (`units`). A book is considered in stock as long as it has at least one unit available. Renting a book decreases its unit count; returning it restores it. The system prevents renting a book that is out of stock.

Two types of users are supported, each with different rental policies:

- **Normal users** can hold only one rented book at a time. They must return their current book before they can rent another one.
- **Premium users** can rent multiple books simultaneously. Each rental and return is tracked individually, and returning a specific book removes only that title from their active rentals.

The codebase includes a structured exception hierarchy (`ValidationError`, `NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`, `BusinessError`, `AuthenticationError`, `InternalError`) that makes error handling predictable and explicit. Every error carries a `code` constant and a human-readable `message`, making it straightforward to integrate with any UI or API layer on top.

The package is installed in editable mode via `pyproject.toml` using a `src/` layout, and exposes a clean public API (`Manager`, `BookModel`, `UserModel`, `UserNormalModel`, `UserPremiumModel`) from its top-level `__init__.py`. The project follows modern Python conventions: strict typing throughout, Ruff for linting and formatting, pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement, and a full pytest test suite covering models, business logic, exceptions, constants, and the manager orchestration layer.

## Technologies used

The project relies on a minimal, modern Python stack:

1. Python >= 3.11

## Libraries used

Dependencies are declared in `pyproject.toml` and split into optional groups so production installs stay minimal.

#### Runtime (`[project.dependencies]`)

```
None — the library has no third-party runtime dependencies.
```

#### Dev (`[project.optional-dependencies]` dev)

```
pre-commit==4.3.0
pip-audit==2.7.3
ruff==0.11.12
mypy==1.13.0
```

#### Test (`[project.optional-dependencies]` test)

```
pytest==9.0.3
pytest-env==1.1.5
pytest-cov==4.1.0
pytest-timeout==2.3.1
pytest-xdist==3.5.0
```

## Getting Started

With the dependencies listed above in mind, follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Go to the repository folder and execute: `python -m venv venv`
3. Execute in Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Execute in Linux/Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the package in editable mode with dev and test extras: `pip install -e .[dev,test]`
6. Run the project:
    1. From CLI (demo): `python -m examples.demo`
    2. Or import as a library in Python: `from lend_book import Manager, BookModel`

### Pre-Commit for Development

Once the environment is ready, enable the pre-commit hooks so that linting and formatting run automatically on every commit:

1. Once you're inside the virtual environment, let's install the hooks specified in the pre-commit. Execute: `pre-commit install`
2. Now every time you try to commit, the pre-commit lint will run. If you want to do it manually, you can run the command: `pre-commit run --all-files`

## Testing

After completing [Getting Started](#getting-started), the full test suite can be run from the repository root:

1. Activate your virtual environment
2. Execute: `pytest --log-cli-level=INFO`

## Security Audit

In addition to running tests, you can check your dependencies for known vulnerabilities using **pip-audit** (already included in the `dev` extra):

1. Go to the repository folder
2. Activate your virtual environment
3. Execute: `pip-audit`

## Continuous Integration

The repository ships with a **GitHub Actions** pipeline defined in [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml). It runs automatically on every `push` and `pull_request` targeting the `main` branch. On `push` to `main`, the same workflow continues with one additional job that produces an automated release.

```

### Validation jobs (run on every PR and push)

1. **`lint-and-audit`** — `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy --config-file=pyproject.toml`, `pip-audit`. Runs on Python 3.13.
2. **`testing`** — installs the `test` extra and runs `pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term` across a matrix of Python **3.11**, **3.12** and **3.13** (with `fail-fast: false` so a regression on one version does not hide results on the others).
3. **`build`** — installs the `build` package and runs `python -m build`, then verifies that a `.tar.gz` source distribution was produced under `dist/`.

### Release job (only on push to `main`)

4. **`release`** — uses [`python-semantic-release`](https://github.com/python-semantic-release/python-semantic-release) to inspect the commits since the latest tag, decide the next SemVer version using [Conventional Commits](#conventional-commits-required-for-releases), bump `project.version` in `pyproject.toml`, regenerate `CHANGELOG.md`, commit the bump, tag it (`vX.Y.Z`), push back to `main`, build the artifacts and publish a GitHub Release with the generated changelog as the release notes. Skipped automatically when the head commit message contains `[skip release]`.

### Conventional Commits (required for releases)

Commits merged into `main` must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) so the pipeline can compute the next version and group the changelog entries.

| Commit prefix | Version bump | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `feat:` / `feat(scope):` | **MINOR** | `feat(manager): add bulk rent operation` |
| `fix:` / `fix(scope):` | **PATCH** | `fix: prevent renting an out-of-stock book` |
| `perf:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `build:`, `ci:`, `chore:`, `style:`, `test:` | **PATCH** | `refactor: extract user dispatch helper` |
| `feat!:` / `fix!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the body | **MAJOR** | `feat!: rename UserPremium.return_book signature` |

When a push contains multiple commits, the highest applicable bump wins (a single `feat:` among many `fix:` triggers a MINOR bump). If you squash-merge PRs, configure the repo to use the PR title as the squash commit message and write the **PR title** following the convention.

### Skipping a release

If you need to push a change to `main` without producing a release (e.g. tweaking job names in the workflow, fixing a typo in the README), append `[skip release]` to the commit message. The validation jobs (lint, test, build) still run; only `release` is skipped.

```bash
git commit -m "ci: rename build job for clarity [skip release]"
```

To skip **everything** including validation, use GitHub's standard `[skip ci]` marker instead.

### Where the build outputs live

| Output | Location |
|---|---|
| Validation logs (lint, tests, coverage) | **Actions** tab on GitHub |
| Source distribution & wheel per version | **Releases** page (sidebar of the repo) |
| Version history & notes | [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) + Releases page |

> **Note:** GitHub's **Packages** section is for package registries (npm, PyPI, Docker, etc.); the sdist and wheel produced by `python -m build` are attached to each GitHub **Release** instead.

### Repository setup required for releases

For the release job to push tags and commits back to `main`, the repository needs:

1. **Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions**: set to *Read and write permissions*.
2. **Branch protection on `main`**: if enabled, allow the `github-actions[bot]` to bypass the PR requirement, or disable the protection for the bot. Otherwise `release` will fail when pushing the version bump.

### Running the same checks locally

```bash
# lint-and-audit
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
mypy --config-file=pyproject.toml .
pip-audit

# testing
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term

# build
python -m build
```

## Known Issues

None at the moment.
